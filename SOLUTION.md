### Running Code

To run the code use 
`npm run start`

Api documentation can be viewed at path
`http://localhost:3000/api`


## Proposed Solution
- Running Issues are resolved
- Dockerized the application
- Fixed issues with the existing test cases
- 

### Refactoring
- Prioritizing
    ### High Prio
    - Add Response structure and standard
    - Adding Swagger to View the API documentation
    - Add details for documentation
    - There should be migrations for the changes in DB
    - Add logs to the api calls    
    
    ### Medium
     - Would rather keep jest configurations only in jest-e2e.json file rather in package.json file
     
    ### Low
    - Adding data type check for the  variable type change in regex function
